            <p>YouPivot has moved! YouPivot has now been merged with another great extension called TimeMarks. TimeMarks is a revolutionary Chrome Extension, changing the way we keep track of our web activity. TimeMarks are an alternative to bookmarking one page, or another - forgetting to write down a URL - or having to manage hundreds of cumbersome links. </p>
            <p>Moreover, YouPivot itself has improved a lot in this new version, including faster rendering speed, better memory management, new user-interface, and much more. Download new version at <a href="http://www.youpivot.com">http://www.youpivot.com/</a> now</p>
